# EmployeeDirectoryApp

This application uses React, specifically the useContext(), useEffect(), and useState() functions in order to build an employee directory where a user can sort through a group of 200 employees. This would be perfect for a user who would want to search through a group of employees and retrieve simple information quickly.
